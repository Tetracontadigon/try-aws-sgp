      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.

      <h1>SpaceX's Inspiration 4 Launch Attempt Today</h1>
      <p><span style="color:#993300;">Four civilians plan to spend 3 days in orbit inside the Crew Dragon capsule.</span></p>
      <p><span>"Inspiration4 marks the first orbital crewed mission where all of the astronauts are private citizens. Paid for by Jared Isaacman, the Inspiration4 mission is a charity fundraiser for St. Jude Childrenâ€™s Research Hospital, with the goal of raising $200 million to help research and fight childhood cancer; to reach this goal, Isaacman is personally donating $100 million. The four person crew is comprised of four civilians, who have never been to space before." - Trevor Sensic.</span></p>

Over the summer, the weather is nice, and there are nice hiking locations. The flora and fauna are diverse. One can cool off in the freshwater streams or the sea. The waters are very clear and produce calming sounds. A nice aspect of the park is the fact that there are beaches in addition to forest areas. Pine trees are very common and the greenery comes in many shades. Another nice aspect of Maine is the seafood including lobster. The blueberries are large and have a combination of a sweet and sour flavor, that is just right. Overall, Acadia National Park is a recommended place for a summer vacation due to the various peaceful and scenic areas.</p>
